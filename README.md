# MOVIES APP USING ANGULAR AND FIREBASE
After i started learning Angular few days ago, finally i end the basics of it ! so that's why i created this app which i tried to put 
and practice everythings i learned so far. So this app is a simple SPA created using Angular for the front-end and for the backend i used somthings i wanted to 
try so long ago, which is Firebase. <br>This app shows movies informations and rating, and gives the users the ability to rate the movies them self and give they opinions, first,
user need to login or register in case he didn't have an account, for the registrasion, the app ask them for only their username an password, username is used when 
the user want to add a review.
When i was building this app i used different topics such us:
<ul>
  <li>Routing</li>
  <li>States</li>
  <li>Services & Dependency Injection</li>
  <li>Features</li>
  <li>Gobal and Scope Styling (SCSS)</li>
  <li>Directives</li>
  <li>Events Handling</li>
  <li>Pipes</li>
  <li>Template-driven Forms</li>
  <li>Data Binding</li>
  <li>Decorators</li>
</ul><br>
